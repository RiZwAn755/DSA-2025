 Dynamic Programming 
 
 1. Tabulation (bottom up)

 2. Memoization (Top Down )



 ------------------------------ Dynamic Programming -------------------------------

 1 Fibbonacchi number

 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 .......

 recurrence relation  = f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ;

 recuerrsive code for it :-

 int f(int n)
 {
    if(n <= 1) return n ;

    return f(n-1 ) + f(n-2) ; 
 }

 recurion tree :- 

                                f(4)
                           f(3)            f(2)
                     f(2)         f(1)


                      here we had to call f(2) multiple times , Its known as overLapping subproblem

                      to solve the overLapping subproblem , Memoization comes in Light , it stores subproblem in some map or table
                      here we have one parameter in f(x) , so we create a one-D array

                      code of Fibbonacchi using Memoization

                       int dp[10010];

                       int f(int n)
                       {
                        if(n <=1 ) return n;

                        if(dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];
                       
                        return dp[n] = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ;   // save and return 
                                                           // i.e solution to this subproblem is f(n) = dp[n]
                        
                       }


                       time Complexity =  O(N)
                       space Complexity = O(N) (recurion stack) + O(N) (Array)



                       recuerrsion => Tabulation 

                       recussion is Top down i.e it goes to required function call if it reches base case it returns 
                       while Tabulation starts from base case

                       dp[0] = 0;
                       dp[1] = 1;

                       for(int i =  2 ; i< n; i++)
                       {
                        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] ;
                       }

                       it is in Tabulation form
