// Binary search trees 

// in bt it never mattered which node is left and which is not right 
// here every node in left must be smaller than right node #pragma endregion


// L < ROOT < Right  

// each subtree also be a BST 
// no duplicate allowed generraly 

// height is generraly Log(N); 

// its kinda binary search in binary tree , as we have to find any node we check if it is greater or smaller than root 
// if its smaller we will skip right subtree and move on left
